Topics covered include: Data processing for data provided as text A recap on EDA approaches: Manipulating, summarising and plotting data Statistical inference: handling missing values; a statistical model for time series data?; time averaging?

"],["set-up-your-r-environment.html", "Chapter 2 Set up your R environment Tasks", " Chapter 2 Set up your R environment Before starting your analysis, it is important to set up your working environment in R. When working in a group, it is useful to have the same base set-up so that you can move code between group members and the code will run easily. Tasks In Session 1, we will implement the following steps to set up your R environment - You only need to do this once: Using Windows Explorer, create a folder for this module on your university ‘U:’ drive with the filepath U:/MAS286/ In your new MAS286 folder, create another new folder called Topic-1_Climate Set up an R-Project to contain your work: In R-studio, click on the project button at the top right of the screen (if you don’t have a project open, the button will say ‘Project: (None)’ on it), and select New Project... On the dialogue box that appears, click on Existing Directory and then use the Browse... option to locate your new folder at: U:/MAS286/Topic-1_Climate. Then click on Create Project to create an R-Project in your folder to hold your work. This process will create an object called Topic-1_Climate.Rproj in your Topic-1_Climate folder. By creating the project, we set the working directory for R to use, and our files become easily accessible in R-studio. In your Topic-1_Climate folder, create another new folder called data. We will use this folder to store any data files required for the exercises in these notes, as well as the data for your group project. Finally, on the module Blackboard page, go to the Data_Files folder in the Course Materials section and save each of the data files it contains in your new data folder. What else need in here?
