[["set-up-your-r-environment.html", "Section 1 Set up your R environment Tasks", " Section 1 Set up your R environment Before starting your analysis, it is important to set up your working environment in R. When working in a group, it is useful to have the same base set-up so that you can move code between group members and the code will run easily. Tasks In the first Session, we will implement the following steps together to set up your R environment - You will only need to do this once: Using Windows Explorer, create a folder for this module on your university ‘U:’ drive with the filepath U:/MPS223/ In your new MPS223 folder, create another new folder called Project-1_Climate Set up an R-Project to contain your work: In R-studio, click on the project button at the top right of the screen (if you don’t have a project open, the button will say ‘Project: (None)’ on it), and select New Project... On the dialogue box that appears, click on Existing Directory and then use the Browse... option to locate your new folder at: U:/MPS223/Project-1_Climate. Then click on Create Project to create an R-Project in your folder to hold your work. This process will create an object called Project-1_Climate.Rproj in your Project-1_Climate folder. By creating the project, we set the working directory for R to use, and our files become easily accessible in R-studio. In your Project-1_Climate folder, create another new folder called data. We will use this folder to store any data files required for the exercises in these notes, as well as the data for your group project. On the module Blackboard page, go to the Computer Labs - Examples data .zip file in the Learning Materials section for Project 1. Download the MPS223_Project1_data.zip file containing all of the data files required for the notes and exercises, and unpack this file so that all of the data files are saved directly in your data folder. Finally, you will need to install the tidyverse set of R packages into R. The Tidyverse is a collection of R packages designed for data science. We will be using a number of these packages (in particular, a package for data manipulation called dplyr, a package for editing strings called stringr and a package for graphics called ggplot2) in this course. Run the following command in your R-console to install it: install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) You only need to install this package once, but every session, you will need to load it with the command library(tidyverse) "],["project-overview.html", "Section 2 Project overview Brief Objectives Project", " Section 2 Project overview Brief This group project is orientated around climate data. Specifically, the cleaning of data, the analysis of data using appropriate exploratory data analysis (EDA) methods, and presenting it to an audience in a way which is a bit more modern than the traditional “stand in front of an audience” method. Objectives Our aim for this project is to simulate a data analysis task which a graduate might be asked to undertake in a workplace. By the end of this project, students should be able to: Conduct themselves professionally and efficiently working in small groups. Clean (i.e. appropriately format) a data set and analyse it using appropriate methods. Work in an organised manner and to a tight deadline. Present your findings as a group via a recorded presentation (i.e. you will not present to a live audience.) Project Scope Your group project is to explore, analyse and interpret a data set collected from the Met Office website and present your work / findings in the form of a video presentation. Your grade for this assignment will be marked based on your video presentation and project log file, as a group. Specifics We do not expect you to analyse in full, the whole data set as this would be a lot of work. We do expect you to discuss the data set in full as part of an introduction, then perhaps focus on one or two attributes for the majority of your presentation. For example, you might pick two of the weather variables, such as maximum temperature and rainfall and compare / discuss / analyse those in detail.
